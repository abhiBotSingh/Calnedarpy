The following program is basically calander that has a UI made by using tkinter module in python.
You can scroll throught the months too and the present date is displayed too. All this has been done by using datetime and calendar modules.
There is also a menubar option that helps you add, edit and delete various events, much like google calendar. The information about the events is stored inside a database which is implemented using pymysql.
There is some work that still needs to be done, like the syntax issue of entering events into the database. I also have to do the work for edit and delete menu fields, which I willdo very soon.
